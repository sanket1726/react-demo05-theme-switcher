# Theme Switcher using ` CONTEXT-API `

> * This is a "Theme-Switcher".  which is just a theme-changer on a button click and span-click. 
> * During this I learnt about `"Context-API"` which is used to manage centralized `states`. Instead of `Redux`. I also learnt about `react-fragment` which is a common pattern in react used for returning multiple elements from a component.

> * Also learnt how props are being shared to pass data between different components, and how it can be decentralized.
